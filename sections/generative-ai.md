## Generative AI

### Models
- Large Language Model (LLM)
- Small Language Model (SLM)
- Foundation Model
- Multimodal Model
- Fine-tuned Model
- Pretrained Model

### Techniques

- Prompt Engineering
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Instruction Tuning
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- In-context Learning
- Few-shot Learning – Commonly used during inference for generalization with limited examples.  
- Zero-shot Learning – Allows models to perform tasks they weren't explicitly trained on.  
- Temperature
- Top-k / Top-p Sampling
- Beam Search
